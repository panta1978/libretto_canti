There we sat down\\
Yeeah we wept,\\
When we remembered Zion. \volte{2}

\strofa When the wicked\\
Carried us away in captivity\\
Required from us a song\\
Now how shall we sing the Lord's song\\
In a strange land. \volte{2}

\spazio

\strofa Let the words of our mouths\\
and the meditations of our hearts\\
be acceptable in thy sight\\
here tonight. \volte{2}

\strofa By the rivers of Babylon,\\
There we sat down\\
Yeeah we wept,\\
When we remembered Zion. \volte{4}
